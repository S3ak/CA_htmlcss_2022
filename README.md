Introduction:
This website is an attempt to recreate my design from our design course. I have tried my best to implement most of what I have learned during this course. For me, this has been both a fun and a frustrating challenge at the same time.

Main section of report:
Design:
As much as I wanted to creat an aesthetically pleasing web site, I have not managed to make an exact copy of the design as in my Figma file. The reason is I didn't have enough time to both make a "perfect" design and includee all the pages, while make everything work properly. I was more focused on trying to make a functional site and a clean code. I still believe this assignment shows a good variety of what I have learned.

HTML and CSS:
I really tried my best to make a clean and neat code, but I am still not 100% sure if it is. Navigating using buttons is solved in a sub-optimal way. The correct way to do this is to wrap each button in a form and add the link to the "action" part of the form. However, this was something I discovered a little too late, so instead of refactoring each link I show that I use it in each form. Source for "best practice": https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2906582/how-do-i-create-an-html-button-that-acts-like-a-link

I have used media queries and flex to make my site responsive. I also tried using several stylesheets to make some costum "settings" for similar stylings on different pages.

Conclusion:
Even though this assignment was a tough challenge for me as a total newbie, I really enjoyed making this website and hope to do even better next time.
