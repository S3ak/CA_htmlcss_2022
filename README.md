Introduction:
This website is an attempt to recreate my design from our design course. I have tried my best to implement most of what I have learned during this course. For me this has been both a fun and a frustrating challange at the same time.

I really tried my best to make a clean and neat code, but I am still not 100% sure if it is.

I have used media queries and flex to make my site responsive. I also tried using several stylesheets to make some costume "settings" for similar stylings on different pages.
