Introduction:
This website is an attempt to recreate my design from our design course. I have tried my best to implement most of what I have learned during this course. For me, this has been both a fun and a frustrating challenge at the same time.

I want to view this assignment first and foremost as a good way to learn everything from this course. Learning by doing is the best way to learn.

Design:
As you can see, I have not managed to make an exact copy of the design as in my Figma file. The reason is I didn't have enough time to both make a "perfect" design and includee all the pages, while make everything work properly. I was more focused on trying to make a functional site.

HTML and CSS:
I really tried my best to make a clean and neat code, but I am still not 100% sure if it is. The errors and alerts I got in the HTML checker and WAVE are referring to things I don't necessarily consider problems, such as using the same links several times (because I have several navs that requires just that), or that some of my buttons has links (don't they need links to work?).

Some of my buttons in the nav bars leads to the same pages, such as favorites and cart. That is simply because I didn't make a favorites page for my design assignment, but I included the button for it.

I have used media queries and flex to make my site responsive. I also tried using several stylesheets to make some costume "settings" for similar stylings on different pages.

Navigating using buttons is solved in a sub-optimal way. The correct way to do this is to wrap each button in a form and add the link to the "action" part of the form. However, this was something I discovered a little too late, so instead of refactoring each link I show that I use it in each form.

Conclusion:
Even though I think this assignment was a little too challanging for
